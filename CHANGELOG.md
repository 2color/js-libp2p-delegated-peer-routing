### chore

* make ipfs-http-client a peer dependency ([#32](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/32)) ([a1b1b5e](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/a1b1b5ec59af97f5ab708c757808940dbcb070d9))

### Features

* add support for api dht/query endpoint ([#37](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/issues/37)) ([6fa569c](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/commit/6fa569cdaaeca3ca200af8b3c10b2a098faff5c1))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The ipfs-http-client must now be installed
as a peer dependency. It is no longer included as a dependency
of this module.

The reason the http-client should be a peerDependency and
not a dependency is that its API requires knowledge of the
http-client (we pass in the api endpoint details).
* findPeer returns id and addrs properties instead of peer-info instance

* chore: address review
